== Description ==
Image Intense is one of the most comprehensive and full-featured modules ever created for both the Divi and Extra themes for the WordPress website development platform. It incorporates features from 3 of the native Divi Builder modules ñ Image, Text and Button ñ and then adds many additional UI/UX enhancements.

With it, you have the power to bring ìabove and beyondî life to your website with one of 22 different image hover transitions, mix blend modes, buttons, opacity settings and several other great features. Use it to entice increased user interaction or motivate with call-to-action elements on a basic e-commerce site that will drive visitors to purchase!

How about coupon reveals or beautiful blend modes on hover? Image Intense is as powerful as you are creative. The features and style options with Image Intense are truly compelling. Like the game of chess ñ simple yet eloquent at the basic level, but astonishingly overwhelming at the master level.

With just a few options, you have a site to look twice at. With some experience, you have a site that draws attention beyond a glance and into the realm of retention and lowered bounce rate.
