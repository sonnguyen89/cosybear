* Version 2.1.4
* MODIFICATION - Removed link whole columns in "DB Loop Archive" module. This is becuase it is not the best practise to have a link around a whole div that has links inside of.
* MODIFICATION - Added "Link Image to Product Page" in "DB Loop Thumbnail" module. This adds a link to the product on your category pages.
* MODIFICATION - Added "On Category Page(loop)" in "DB Pro/Loop Product Title" module. When you select this, a further option appears that allows you to link to the product page. The link doesnt need to be on the product page, that is why we have a first step (to check if you are displaying it on the category layout)
* MODIFICATION - Added a select option  in "DB Loop Thumbnail" module to select your preferred thumbnail style. So far we have added: default, image only (no overlay) & flip image (hover over image and it transistions to the first image on the gallery)
*
* Version 2.1.3
* FIX - issue with conflict with Divi Nitro.
*
* Version 2.1.2

			* Set padding on top and bottom
* MODIFICATION - DB Log Login Form & DB Log Register Form - Added an option to redirect the user if logged in to the account section. This is useful if you are using the login module somewhere else on the site. Before it only redirected if you used it in the layout assigned to the login section.
